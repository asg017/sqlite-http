# sqlite-http

A SQLite extension for making HTTP requests purely in SQL.

- Create GET, POST, or any other HTTP requests and download responses, like `curl`, `wget`, and `fetch`
- Query HTTP headers, cookies, timing information
- Set rate limits, timeouts

## ðŸš§ðŸš§ Work In Progress! ðŸš§ðŸš§

This library is experimental and subject to change. I plan to make a stable beta release and subsequent v0+v1 in the near future, so use with caution.

When v0 is ready (with a mostly stable API), I will make a release (so watch this repo for that) and will make a blog post, feel free to [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/agarcia_me) to get notified of that.

## Installing

`sqlite-http` is distributed as a [runtime-loadable](https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html) SQLite extension. Depending on your operating system, you'll need to either download the compiled `.dylib`, `.so`, or `.dll` file and load it
into your SQLite environment.

TODO document release download

For example, if you plan on using it on the command line using `sqlite3`:

```bash
sqlite> .load ./http0
sqlite> select http_get("...");
```

Note: by default, the `sqlite3` CLI pre-installed on MacOS systems don't allow for loading extensions, so try downloading another version (ex. from [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/sqlite)) to use `sqlite-http` properly on Mac.

## Documentation

See [`api.md`](./api.md) for a full API reference.

## Examples

First, let's load the extension using the [`.load`](https://www.sqlite.org/cli.html#loading_extensions) command in SQLite's CLI.

```sql
.load http0.so
```

> Note: Loading extensions may be disabled by default in your computer's builtin `sqlite3` CLI. Consider downloading a [newer version of SQLite](https://sqlite.org/download.html). Also look into your favorite SQLite client library API for how to load extensions, like Python's [`load_extension`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.load_extension), Node.js's [`loadExtesion`](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3/blob/master/docs/api.md#loadextensionpath-entrypoint---this) in `better-sqlite`, or the [`load_extension`](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#load_extension) function in some SQLite libraries.

## Testing

Testing the output `.so` is in `test.py`. Tests require a local instance of [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/) to work. If you have docker, run `docker httpbin` to start an instance on port 8080. If you want to skip tests that require httpbin (ex CI scripts), then set a `SKIP_DO` environment varaible to `""`, like sp:

```
SKIP_DO=1; python3 test.py
```
